# Input Validations

Generally when we gather inputs from the users, its a good practice to validate the inputs before processing them. This is where input validation comes into picture. In this section we will see how to validate the inputs using the `zod` library latter in the docs.

But what really happens when user sends faulty inputs? Well, the server will throw an error. But we need to handle the error and send a proper response to the user. We will see how to do that in the next section. But first lets see an example of the faulty behaviour.

```javascript
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.post("/health-checkup", (req, res) => {
  // do something with kidney here
  const kidneys = req.body.kidneys;
  const kidneyLength = kidneys.length;

  res.send(`You have ${kidneyLength} kidneys`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

How can we do better input validation? Well we can pass manual checks to the `kidneyId`s and `kidneyLength` to make sure that they are valid. But this is not a good practice.

```javascript
if (kidneyId != 1 && kidneyId != 2) {
  return false;
}
```

But this approach is hard to scale, and it is not a good practice if we expect complex inputs. So we will use the `zod` library to validate the inputs.

## Zod

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a `TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference`. Sounds complecated? Well lets just focus on `schema validation` for now.

Lets understand better with an example.

```javascript {10,16-20}
const express = require("express");
const z = require("zod");

const app = express();

// add middleware to parse the request body
app.use(express.json());

// defining the schema for the kidneyId that will have a safeParse method to validate the input
const kidneySchema = z.literal("1").or(z.literal("2"));

app.post("/health-checkup", (req, res) => {
  // do something with kidney here
  const kidneyId = req.body.kidneyId;
  // the validation will return an object with a boolean `success` and `data` property
  const validation = kidneySchema.safeParse(kidneyId);
  if (!validation.success) {
    // if the validation fails, we will send a 400 response
    return res.status(400).send(validation.error);
  }
  // if the validation succeeds, we will send a 200 response
  res.status(200).send(`You have ${kidneyLength} kidneys`);
});
```

## Basic Usage

Creating a simple string schema.

```javascript
import { z } from "zod";

// creating a schema for strings
const mySchema = z.string();

// parsing
mySchema.parse("tuna"); // => "tuna"
mySchema.parse(12); // => throws ZodError

// "safe" parsing (doesn't throw error if validation fails)
mySchema.safeParse("tuna"); // => { success: true; data: "tuna" }
mySchema.safeParse(12); // => { success: false; error: ZodError }
```

Creating a object schema.

```javascript
import { z } from "zod";

const User = z.object({
  username: z.string(),
});

User.parse({ username: "Ludwig" });

// extract the inferred type
type User = z.infer<typeof User>;
// { username: string }
```
