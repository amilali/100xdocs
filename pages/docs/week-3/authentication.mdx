# Authentication

By now anyone can send requests to your backend, they can just go to postman and send a request.
How do you ensure that this user has access to a certain resource?

Dumb way - Ask user to send `username` and `password` in all requests as headers, quite combersome.

Better way - Use `JWT` (JSON Web Token) to authenticate users.

> Simple assignment for now to create a login route that accepts a request and lets you sign in if you have the user registered in your backend.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// add json middleware to parse json requests
app.use(express.json());

// create a user object
const USERS = [
  {
    username: "harkirat",
    password: "sonam-bajwa?",
  },
  {
    username: "aryan",
    password: "rookie",
  },
  {
    username: "manish",
    password: "yc-funded-boi",
  },
];

// create a login route
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  // get username and password from request body
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  // check if user exists
  const user = USERS.find((user) => user.username === username);

  // if user does not exist
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "User not found" });
  }

  // if password does not match
  if (user.password !== password) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Password does not match" });
  }

  // if everything is fine, send a success message
  res.json({ message: "Login successful" });
});
```

## JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

Lets see what the library page says about it. [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
