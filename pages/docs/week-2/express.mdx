# Introduction to Express

In this class, we covered fundamental concepts related to the HTTP protocol, status codes, and an introduction to the Express framework.

## HTTP Protocol Basics

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. In the context of web development, there are two primary types of HTTP requests:

- **GET Request**: Used to request data from a specified resource. For example, when you visit a webpage, your browser sends a GET request to the server to retrieve the HTML, CSS, and other assets needed to render the page.

- **POST Request**: Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. When you submit a form on a web page, the data is often sent to the server using a POST request.

## Status Codes

Here are some commonly encountered status codes:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server responded with the requested data.
  
- **404 Not Found**: The server could not find the requested resource. This often occurs when a URL is mistyped or the resource has been removed.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message returned when an unexpected condition was encountered on the server. This indicates that there is an issue on the server side.

## Express Framework

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building web servers and handling HTTP requests.

Key features of Express include:

- **Routing**: Express allows you to define routes that map to specific URL patterns. In the provided code, we have routes for the root path ("/"), "/about", and handling both GET and POST requests.

- **Middleware**: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The `body-parser` middleware, used in the code, is responsible for parsing incoming JSON requests.

## Code Example

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3005;

app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Handling GET requests
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.send('About us');
});

// Handling POST requests
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Server Listening
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Example app is listening at port ${port}`);
});
