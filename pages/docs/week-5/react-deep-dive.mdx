## Jargons and Concepts

- class vs className
- static vs dynamic websites
- states
- components
- re-rendering

## Why do we need React ?

> For static websites you really dont need React. Lets look at a HTML skeleton of a static website.

> But for dynamic websites, React is a must. It just eases the process of creating dynamic interactions in your website. Lets look at an implementation of dynamic website without React.

## Why React ?

React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS. It is a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS.

Under the hood there are bundlers that come into picture like webpack, parcel, rollup etc. that convert the React code to HTML/CSS/JS.
The process of bundling is called transpiling. The bundlers also do a lot of other things like minification, tree shaking, code splitting etc these are optimizations that are done to the code for efficient delivery to the browser.
